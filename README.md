Technical SEO / Web Performance / Analytics  
San José, Costa Rica

I work on search-critical systems where **crawlability, rendering, performance, and measurement** must coexist without breaking each other.

---

## What I focus on

### Technical SEO as a systems problem
- Information architecture at scale
- Crawl budget control, indexation logic, canonicalization
- Internal linking models that survive growth
- Sitemaps and parameter strategies for large sites

### JavaScript & rendering
- SSR / CSR / hydration trade-offs
- Debugging rendering and indexation issues in JS environments
- Understanding differences between browser output and search engine rendering

### Performance
- Core Web Vitals as a hard constraint, not a KPI
- Performance regression prevention
- Measuring impact beyond lab metrics

### Measurement
- Event design tied to business logic
- GA4 + GTM implementations that support decision-making
- Enterprise analytics contexts (including Adobe Analytics)

---

## Background (high level)

Experience working on **large, multilingual, high-traffic websites**, across:
- JS-driven and PHP-based stacks
- Agency and enterprise environments
- Close collaboration with engineering, analytics, and product teams

Focus has consistently been on **diagnosing structural issues**, not surface-level optimization.

- **SaldoSimple** — financial calculators and SEO-driven tools (MX)
- **SmartCalcLab** — calculation tools for the US market, built with SEO, performance, and data export in mind

### Technical interests
- SEO-friendly web applications

- Automation for audits, monitoring, and anomaly detection

## When I’m a good fit

- JS-rendered sites with indexation or performance issues
- Situations where SEO, engineering, and analytics must align
- Teams that value clear diagnostics over generic recommendations
