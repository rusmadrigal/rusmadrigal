# Rusben Madrigal

**Technical SEO Engineer • Web Performance • Analytics**  
San José, Costa Rica — I build search-friendly systems where **rendering, performance, and measurement** actually agree.

## A different kind of SEO profile

Most profiles list tools.  
Mine lists **constraints**—because that’s what ships in real systems.

- **SEO is architecture**, not a checklist.
- **Performance is a feature**, not a nice-to-have.
- **Analytics is a decision system**, not a dashboard.
- **AI is leverage**, not a substitute for judgment.

---

## How I work (my operating principles)

**1) Make it crawlable**
- Clean information architecture, internal linking models, crawl budget discipline  
- Indexation control (canonicals, pagination, parameter strategy, sitemaps at scale)

**2) Make it renderable**
- JS/SSR/CSR realities, hydration tradeoffs, bot behavior  
- Debug what *Google actually sees* (not what the browser shows)

**3) Make it fast**
- Core Web Vitals as an engineering constraint  
- Performance budgets, regression prevention, measurable wins

**4) Make it measurable**
- GA4 + GTM + (when needed) Adobe Analytics  
- Events that map to business outcomes, not vanity metrics

---

## What I’m strong at (the short list)

- **Technical SEO:** site architecture, crawl/indexation, log analysis, JS SEO, structured data  
- **Web Performance:** CWV optimization, performance monitoring, shipping sustainably  
- **Analytics:** GA4, GTM, Looker Studio (and Adobe Analytics in enterprise contexts)  
- **Engineering collaboration:** translate SEO requirements into dev-ready tickets + validation

---

## Toolbelt (only what I actually use)

- **Frameworks:** Next.js, React  
- **SEO:** Screaming Frog, SEMrush (plus auditing/monitoring workflows)  
- **Analytics:** GA4, GTM, Looker Studio, Adobe Analytics

## If you’re hiring

I’m a fit when you need someone who can:
- diagnose **complex technical SEO issues** across large sites
- work comfortably with **engineers** (and speak their language)
- ship **measurable improvements** (crawlability, CWV, indexation, tracking)

**Best role fit:** Senior Technical SEO / Technical SEO Lead / SEO Engineer / Web Performance + SEO
